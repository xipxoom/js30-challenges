# Javascript 30
## Lesson 1
### (Semi)blind Attempt

This is my attempt to solve the first challenge of [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com/)'s [Javascript 30 Day Challenge](https://javascript30.com/) free course to create a drum kit before actually watching the video.  I glanced at some of the files from the [lesson 1 github](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30/tree/master/01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit) first so I can't take 100% credit for the entire solution.  I'm finding I'm WAY out of practice and having to look up even the simplest css and javascript.  Yes - I'm attempting (at least in this case) to build the whole thing on my own.
