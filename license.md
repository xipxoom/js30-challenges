# License

## Course
This project is inspired by [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com/) for his [Javascript 30 Day Challenge](https://javascript30.com/) free course.  I do not presume to know the license or copyright status of these files as I could not locate anything explicit.  However it seems logical that, being a course, this usage is allowed.  ;-)  The course files for this challenge can be found [On his project's github](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30/tree/master/03%20-%20CSS%20Variables).

## index.html, style.css, app.js
These files are based conceptually on the above course.  As I cannot identify a license for the course files I, again, will not presume to spell out any limitations or freedoms.  Use your head and don't be a dick. :-)
