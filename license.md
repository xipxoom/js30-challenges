# License

## Course

This project is inspired by Wes Bos for his Javascript 30 Day Challenge free course. I do not presume to know the license or copyright status of these files as I could not locate anything explicit. However it seems logical that, being a course, this usage is allowed. ;-) The course files for this challenge can be found On his project's github.

## index.html, app.js

These files are based conceptually on the above course. As I cannot identify a license for the course files I, again, will not presume to spell out any limitations or freedoms. Use your head and don't be a dick. :-)
