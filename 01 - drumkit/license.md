## Background
Irongrip.png is licensed under [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).  It was created by [Tony Kinard](http://tonykinard.net/) and discovered via [Subtle Patterns](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/?s=irongrip).

## Sounds
All the .wav files are provided by [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com/) for his [Javascript 30 Day Challenge](https://javascript30.com/) free course.  I do not presume to know the license or copyright status of these files.  However it seems logical that, being a course, this usage is allowed.  ;-)  They \(and the rest of the files for this lesson\) can be found [here](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30/tree/master/01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit).

## index.html, style.css, drumkit.js
These files are based conceptually on the above course.  As I cannot identify a license for the course files I, again, will not presume to spell out any limitations or freedoms.  Use your head and don't be a dick. :-)
