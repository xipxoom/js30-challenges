# Javascript 30
## Lesson 2
### Blind Attempt

This is my attempt to solve the second challenge of [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com/)'s [Javascript 30 Day Challenge](https://javascript30.com/) free course to create an analog clock before actually watching the video.  I brainstormed for an hour trying to figure out how to manage this without using canvas draws.  I think I came up with the solution most people would - using a border on one side of a square div for each clock hand and then translating them into position.
