# Javascript 30
## Lesson 3
### Solo attempt

This is my attempt to solve the second challenge of [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com/)'s [Javascript 30 Day Challenge](https://javascript30.com/) free course to create a page demonstrating some simple usage of css variables.  This time I watched the video ahead of time as I had no idea these were even implemented and working (Except for IE/Edge... surprise surprise).
